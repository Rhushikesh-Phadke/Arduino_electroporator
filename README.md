# Arduino_electroporator
Arduino IDE code for electroporator

The code can be opened in arduino IDE, and can be uploaded to the board.

The number of pulses, duration of each pulse and interpulse interval can all be adjusted in the initialised variables. 

The footpedal analog read should be 1023 when pressed in most cases, but if it is not, then repalce 1023 with the readout of the footpedal.
